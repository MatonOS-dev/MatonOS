# MatonOS Flatpak stub APK format v1

A stub APK is a small, signed package record for one installed Flatpak app. It
contains no application implementation. The shared code is supplied by the
updatable `org.matonos.compositor` host through Android's dynamic shared
library mechanism. The stub APK is signed on-device with the per-device key
held by Android Keystore; it is not portable to another device.

## Contents

The v1 package contains:

- A binary `AndroidManifest.xml` with the Flatpak display label, the required
  `<uses-library android:name="org.matonos.linuxhost"/>`, approved Android
  permission declarations, a launcher activity whose class is
  `org.matonos.compositor.stub.StubActivity`, and a placeholder service class
  `org.matonos.compositor.stub.StubService`.
- An `ACTION_MAIN` / `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER` filter. Each valid MIME type from the
  `.desktop` file's `MimeType=` entry is represented by its own `ACTION_VIEW`
  filter with `CATEGORY_DEFAULT` and `CATEGORY_BROWSABLE`.
- Activity metadata `org.matonos.linuxhost.FLATPAK_REF` containing the exact
  installed ref and `org.matonos.linuxhost.MIN_INTERFACE_VERSION` containing
  the minimum host interface version (currently `1`).
- A minimal empty `resources.arsc` table required by Android PackageManager
  even though the stub declares no compiled resources.
- The caller-provided PNG at `assets/matonos-stub/icon.png` and an empty,
  valid `classes.dex`. The icon is retained as a package asset; the store can
  decode/resize it when presenting the catalog.

Package names are selected by the caller and must be unique Android package
names. Stub format version is `1`; it is separate from the host interface
version. The Flatpak ref is checked against the standard
`app|runtime/name/arch/branch` form. Unsupported desktop MIME strings are
skipped. Localized desktop labels and desktop actions are not part of v1.

## Host interface

`HostContract.INTERFACE_VERSION` is the host ABI version. The host launcher
reads the ref and minimum version from the stub activity metadata. It routes
to the compositor host Activity and presents an explicit not-wired message
until the Flatpak runtime launch hook is connected. `StubService` is reserved
for future per-app D-Bus and portal integration; it does not implement those
features in v1.

The stub generator is `MatonLinuxStubGenerator` in `linux/stubgen`. Its Java
entry point accepts an app-private work directory, Flatpak ref, `.desktop` file, PNG bytes,
permission list, package name, and output APK file. It encodes the small
binary XML vocabulary directly, so it does not require AAPT2 on-device, then
signs with `apksig`. The Android Keystore alias
`matonos_flatpak_stub_v1` is created on first use as a non-exportable EC
P-256 signing key.

## Stock PackageManager multiarch handling

The first on-device attempt used a host APK without `android:multiArch` and
PackageManager rejected that library provider because it contained JNI
libraries. AOSP's `PackageAbiHelperImpl` handles `pkg.isMultiArch()` in a
separate ABI path before the single-ABI branch that throws
`Shared library with native libs must be multiarch`. The host manifest now
sets `<application android:multiArch="true"/>`; AAPT2 confirms the flag is
present. A fresh-image build and stub-install retest are pending. If the
multiarch APK still cannot register as a shared-library provider, use the
Java-only provider/native-engine split documented as a contingency in
[SHARED-CHANGES.md](SHARED-CHANGES.md), without patching AOSP.

## Verification status

On a fresh QEMU boot, the generator produced a signed APK using Android
Keystore. The fixed manifest parsed through reconciliation. That image's host
APK did not yet declare `android:multiArch="true"`, so PackageManager did not
register the dynamic library and the stub failed with
`INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY`. The rebuilt host APK now sets the
flag; install and launcher verification on an image containing it are pending.

After the provider/engine split, repeat on a freshly built and booted image:

1. Expose `MatonLinuxStubGenerator` to a small trusted test caller (the store
   app or bridge; integration is out of scope here).
2. Generate a stub for `app/org.example.Test/x86_64/stable` with a minimal
   Desktop Entry, PNG, and no permissions.
3. Install it with `pm install -r /data/local/tmp/test.apk`, verify `pm path`
   and dynamic-library resolution, then launch its launcher activity.
4. Confirm the host shows the explicit “Flatpak runtime launcher is not
   wired” message until the runtime hook is connected.

## Follow-up contract for the bridge and store

The store must choose the package name, map requested Flatpak permissions to
the approved Android permission list, provide the exported `.desktop` file
and selected icon bytes, and invoke the generator when installing or
updating a ref. The bridge/store integration also needs a narrow caller
surface for this library and policy for which signed callers may mint stubs.
The installed per-device key must not be exported or copied; after a reset,
stubs are re-minted from installed refs and store metadata.
